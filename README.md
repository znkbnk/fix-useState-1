Here's an example of React code 
using React version 16.8 with
mistakes and you have to fix them.

Step 1: Import statement

- The import statement is incorrect
for using the useState hook from React.

Step 2: Function component

- The component should be defined as
a function component, not a class component.

Step 3: State declaration

- The state declaration using the useState
hook is almost correct. However, 
the let keyword is missing before
[count, setCount]. 

Step 4: Event handler

- The increment function is not declared
correctly. It should be declared using
the const keyword.
